### Describe the original project

- The original project was intended to recreate the famous Monty Hall Game. This consist of three doors, and behind
each one there is a prize, but behind one special door there is a huge prize. The host of the game would give the user the option to play the live game or to simulate the entire game. When the user decided to stop playing, statistics would be displayed.

- If the user decided to play the live game, the host would offer the user to select one door. Before revealing the prize, the host of the game would reveal one door which does not contain the prize nor is the user selection. Then, the user would have the option to switch to the remaining door, with the hope that the prize is behind that one, or not to switch and stick with his choice.

### What files are part of the original solution?

- The file ***GameShow.py*** contains the original project created in Python.

### What files are part of your converted solution

- The file ***main_program.cpp*** contains the implementation of all the files, thus is the main file.
- The file ***functions.cpp*** contains all the functions used in this project, which are implemented in the file ***main_program.cpp***.
- The file ***headers.h*** contains the function declaration of all the functions definitions in the file ***functions.cpp***.
- The file ***testing.cpp*** contains the unit testing for two important functions.

### What challenges did you have in converting your program?

- I think the greatest challenge was trying to figure out the algorithm to return a door that did not contain the prize nor the user door. After a few minutes thinking about it, I was able to come up with a solution for it, although it's not the most efficient, but it works :).

- I had fun programming in C++. I feel like C++ develops my sense of logical thinking and reasoning due to its syntax complexity. I also became a good debugger (I think) because I would get a bunch of errors but it turns out that I did not have to solve them all because the first error was the cause of the rest of the errors.

### What language was better suited for the task? Explain why.

- I would say Python because I'm still getting used to C++. Due to the simplicity of Python, it's easier to understand the code and also easier to code what you think.
