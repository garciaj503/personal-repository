# CPTR 141: Project #2

## Problem Overview
Your next project is to write a Python program to implement the so-called "Russian Peasant" or "Ancient Egyptian" multiplication algorithm.  While the algorithm is probably not familiar to you, just think of it as an alternative to the multiplication process you earned in elementary school.  If you are interested in more information on why the algorithm works, you can find it [on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication) and [other sites](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/PeasantMultiplication.shtml).

Here is how the algorithm works.  Suppose you wish to multiply two integers ``A`` and ``B`` together (no decimals allowed). 

* You would first write the values of ``A`` and ``B`` side-by-side in two columns.
* Then you create a new row with twice the previous value in the ``A`` column, and half the previous value (truncated) in the ``B`` column.
*  Continue this doubling/halving step until the value in the ``B`` column is zero.
*  Finally, add up all of the values in the ``A`` column that go with an odd value in the ``B`` column.  That sum will be the product of the original ``A`` and ``B`` values.

Here is an example using relatively small values of ``A=34`` and ``B=19``.

<table cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="alg">
  <tr>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>Comment</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="odd">34</td>
    <td class="odd">19</td>
    <td>Since 19 is odd, we will add 34 to the product</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="odd">68</td>
    <td class="odd">9</td>
    <td>Since 9 is odd, we will add 68 to the product</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>136</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Since 4 is even, we will ignore the 136</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>272</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Since 2 is even, we will ignore the 272</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="odd">544</td>
    <td class="odd">1</td>
    <td>Since 1 is odd, add 544 and since 1/2 == 0, we stop</td>
  </tr>  
</table>

If a row has an odd value in the ``B`` column, we add the ``A`` column value together to get:

```
34 + 68 + 544 = 646
```

Thus, the product of 39 and 19 is 646.  Check it out with other numbers.  It will work every time!

## Solution Specification
Your solution should strive to meet the standards specified below as they form the basis on which it will be graded.

1. Your program must prompt the user for two integers in some easy-to-follow fashion and perform appropriate validation checks on the user input.  It should work for both positive and negative numbers, but start with positives only.

2. You should then show how the algorithm proceeds in some fashion.  A table, similar to the first two columns of the one above, might be a nice way to do that but be creative!

3. After the result of one computation is displayed, ask the user if they wish to perform another computation or exit the program.  Again, perform validation checks on the user input and then act on it as appropriate.

4. Since this is a project, you have a lot of freedom in how you choose to accomplish the task.  However, you are expected to make use of the following concepts somewhere in your program.

    * Appropriately named variables
    * Python computation (addition, multiplication, division, etc.)
    * At least one Boolean expression
    * At least one branching statement (``if``, ``else``, and/or ``elif``)
    * At least one iteration statement (``while`` and/or ``for``)

## Code Review and Grading
Before you can receive an ``M`` on your project, you must participate in a [code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) with a CS tutor at the Student Development Center.  This walk-through style review is a guided-tour of your source code in which you describe how you implemented the various features, explain why you made the choices you did, and solicit constructive input which might help improve your final product.  Turn in the signed form to your instructor.

Once your final product has been turned in, it will be graded according to the following rubric.

<table id="grade" cellspacing="0">
